# Marketing Campaign Analysis Project

**Description:** In this project, I used Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualisation and analysis. The data contains different details about customer demographics, purchases, and responses to campaigns. This report gives an overview of a marketing campaign dataset with 2240 customers. The goal is to derive insights into customer behaviour and understand the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns.

**Tools:** 
- Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Power BI: Data visualization and analysis

**Skills:**

- Data cleaning (e.g.: nulls & duplicates handling, data correction and consistency, outliers detection)
- Analyzed customer demographics, purchase behavior, and campaign effectiveness.
- Created interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI.
- Developed custom measures using the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language in Power BI to extract meaningful insights.

**Outputs:**  
- Excel workbook in `.xlsx` format with multiple tabs covering raw data and cleaned data
- Visualization in '.Pbix' and '.pdf' format with with 7 different charts, slicer, 7 cards, and insights
- Presentation slides in `.pdf` format containing problem statement, objectives, data overview, findings, and recommendations.

## Results
This report gives an overview of a marketing campaign dataset with 2240 customers. The following insights were derived from the analysis:

- PowerBi Measures using DAX: Average Catalog Purchases, Average Deals Purchases, Average Store Purchases, Average Web Purchases, Average Age, Average Catalog Purchase Value, Average Deals Purchase Value, Average Income, Average Store Purchase Value, and Average Web Purchase Value measures were created.
- Significant Factors for Web Purchases: Education, marital status, and income significantly affect web purchases.
- Most Successful Campaign: Campaign 4, which accounts for 25% of the total campaigns.
- Average Customer Profile: The average customer is 55 years old with an average income of 51.96k.
- Top Performing Product: Wines are the best-performing product.
- Underperforming Channel: Deal purchases are the least effective channel, constituting only 15.64% of purchases.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing on segments defined by education, marital status, and income to boost web sales.

- Increase focus on marketing wines, the top-performing product.
- Investigate and improve strategies for the underperforming deal purchases channel.
- Tailor marketing strategies to high-potential regions identified through deeper geographic analysis.
